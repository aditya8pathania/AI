## 📂 Code Files and Details

### 1. **Alpha-Beta Pruning** (`Alpha-Beta-Pruning.cpp`)
   - 💡 **Description**: Implements the alpha-beta pruning optimization for the minimax algorithm, used in decision-making for adversarial games like chess.
   - ⚡ **Example**: 
     - Input: Game tree with values at leaf nodes.
     - Output: Optimal move with pruned nodes to save computation.
   - 📖 **Usage**:
     ```cpp
     // Compile and run
     // Provides the optimal decision using alpha-beta pruning
     ```

### 2. **BFS and DFS Practice** (`Prac1_BFS-DFS.cpp`)
   - 🌳 **Description**: Explore Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) techniques for graph traversal.
   - 🚀 **Example**:
     - Input: A graph represented as an adjacency list.
     - Output: Traversal order for both BFS and DFS.
   - 📖 **Usage**:
     ```cpp
     // Input a graph and see BFS and DFS traversal order
     ```

### 3. **Iterative Deepening Depth First Search** (`Prac3_IterativeDeepeningDepthFirstSearch.cpp`)
   - 🕵️‍♂️ **Description**: Combines the benefits of DFS and BFS by exploring levels progressively.
   - ⚡ **Example**:
     - Input: Graph with a target node.
     - Output: Search completed with minimal memory overhead.
   - 📖 **Usage**:
     ```cpp
     // Iterative deepening to find target with reduced space complexity
     ```

### 4. **Best First Search** (`Prac4-BestFirstSearch.py`)
   - 🔍 **Description**: A greedy approach to traverse a graph using the best candidate based on a heuristic.
   - 🚀 **Example**:
     - Input: Weighted graph and heuristic function.
     - Output: Path with the best heuristic value.
   - 📖 **Usage**:
     ```python
     # Run the script to find the optimal path using heuristics
     ```

### 5. **Tic Tac Toe - Magic Square Approach** (`Tic_Tac_Toe_MagicSquare.cpp`)
   - 🎮 **Description**: Implements the magic square approach for Tic Tac Toe to identify winning strategies efficiently.
   - 🧩 **Example**:
     - Input: Player moves.
     - Output: AI's winning move based on magic square.
   - 📖 **Usage**:
     ```cpp
     // Play Tic Tac Toe with an optimized winning strategy
     ```

### 6. **Tic Tac Toe - Minimax** (`Tic_Tac_Toe_Minmax.py`)
   - 🤖 **Description**: Uses the minimax algorithm to play Tic Tac Toe with optimal decision-making.
   - 🚀 **Example**:
     - Input: Player moves.
     - Output: AI move with minimax strategy.

     ```python
     # Play against an AI using minimax to ensure no loss
     ```

### 7. **Ultimate Tic Tac Toe** (`Uf_Tic_Tac_Toe.py`)
   - 🎯 **Description**: A more complex version of Tic Tac Toe where AI strategies are optimized for winning.
   - 🧠 **Example**:
     - Input: Multiple board configurations.
     - Output: Winning strategy for the AI.
   - 📖 **Usage**:
     ```python
     # Challenge yourself with the ultimate version of Tic Tac Toe!
     ```

### 8. **K-Knights Problem** (`k-Knights.cpp`)
   - 🏇 **Description**: Solves the k-knights problem on a chessboard to find a non-attacking arrangement.
   - 🚀 **Example**:
     - Input: Number of knights and board size.
     - Output: Safe configuration for the knights.
   - 📖 **Usage**:
     ```cpp
     // Input k and n to solve the k-knights arrangement
     ```
